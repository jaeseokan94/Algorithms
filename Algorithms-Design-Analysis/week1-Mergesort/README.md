Learned how to solve problems with divide-conquer methods.  Mergesort algorithm is useful since it is O(NLogN) algorithm unlike insertion,selection sort 0(N^2).

Coursework is counting numeber of split inversions in given array. 

Input : 100,000 integers (Integers between 1 - 100,000) 

Inversion meaning from wikipedia :  an inversion is a pair of places of a sequence where the elements on these places are out of their natural order.
