<h3> This repo contains my Java & Python scripts for algorithms practice. </h3>

- Stanford's algorithms: Design and Analysis (10 weeks Coursera program cosists of weekly programming coursework.)
- APAC - Google : It is a series of programming contests for University students, and my folder includes various solutions for previous tests. Coded in Java.
- Basic algorithm : Solutions for all kind of basic algorithms questions. Used both Java and Python.
